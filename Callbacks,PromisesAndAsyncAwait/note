Sync in JS

Synchronous 
Synchronous means the code runs ina particular sequence of intructions given in the program.
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

Asynchronous
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instruction get blocked due to some previous instruction, which cause a delay in the UI.
Asynchronous code execution allows to execution next instruction immediately and doesn't block the flow.

Callbacks
A callback is a function passed as a argument to another function.

Callback Hell
Callback Hell : Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure.
(Pyramid of Doom)

This style of programming becoms difficult to understand & manage.

Promises 
Promise is for "eventual" completion of task. It is an object in JS.
It is a solution to callback hell.

let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {....})-> Function with 2 handlers

*resolve & reject are callbacks provided by JS.

A JavaScript Promise object can be:
    -> Pending : the result is undefined
    -> Resolved : the result is a value (fulfilled)         resolve(result)
    -> Rejected : the result is an error object             reject(error)

*Promise has state (pending, fulfilled) & some result (result for resolve & error for reject ). 

Promises 
.then() &.catch()
promise.then((res) => {....})
promise.catch((err) => {....})
