Sync in JS

Synchronous 
Synchronous means the code runs ina particular sequence of intructions given in the program.
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

Asynchronous
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instruction get blocked due to some previous instruction, which cause a delay in the UI.
Asynchronous code execution allows to execution next instruction immediately and doesn't block the flow.
