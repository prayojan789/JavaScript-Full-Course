Prototype_in_JS

A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
JS objects have a special property called prototype.
We can set prototype using __proto__

*If object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.

Prototype -> Objects -> reference to an object.

#Classes in JS
Class is a program-code template for creating objects.
Those objects will have some state (variables)& some behaviour(functions) inside it.

classMyclass{
    constructor(){...}
    my Method(){...}
}

let myObject = newMyclass();

Inheritance in JS
inheritance is passing down properties & methode from parent class to child class.

class Parent{
}
class Child extends Parent{
}

*If Child & Parent have same method, child's method will be used.[Method Overriding]

Super keyboard
The super keyboard is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.
        super(args)//calls Parent's constructor
        super.parentMethod(args)

Let's Practice

Q1. You are creating a wedsite for your college. Create a class User with 2 properties, name & email. It also has a method called viewData() that allows user to view website data.

Q2. Create a new class called Admin which inherits from  User. Add a new method called editData tp Admin that allows website data.
