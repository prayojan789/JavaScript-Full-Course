Prototype_in_JS

A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
JS objects have a special property called prototype.
We can set prototype using __proto__

*If object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.

Prototype -> Objects -> reference to an object.

#Classes in JS
Class is a program-code template for creating objects.
Those objects will have some state (variables)& some behaviour(functions) inside it.

classMyclass{
    constructor(){...}
    my Method(){...}
}

let myObject = newMyclass();
